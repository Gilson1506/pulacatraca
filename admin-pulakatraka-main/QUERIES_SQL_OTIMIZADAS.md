## üöÄ USO NO C√ìDIGO

### **Exemplo: Buscar dados do Dashboard**

```typescript
// Query otimizada com Supabase
const { data: orderStats } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_dashboard_stats', {
    start_date: startDate.toISOString(),
    end_date: endDate.toISOString()
  });
```

### **Fun√ß√£o SQL para Dashboard:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_dashboard_stats(
  start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
)
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
  result JSON;
BEGIN
  SELECT json_build_object(
    'total_orders', COUNT(*),
    'paid_orders', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status IN ('paid', 'completed')),
    'total_revenue', SUM(total_amount) FILTER (WHERE payment_status IN ('paid', 'completed')),
    'average_order_value', AVG(total_amount) FILTER (WHERE payment_status IN ('paid', 'completed')),
    'pending_orders', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'pending'),
    'canceled_orders', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE canceled_at IS NOT NULL)
  ) INTO result
  FROM orders
  WHERE created_at BETWEEN start_date AND end_date;
  
  RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
